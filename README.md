### Deep Learning Specialization Programming Assignments - DeepLearning.AI 
#### Being a Deep Learning practitioner is not about technology. It's about solving real word problems and positively impacting society.

This repository contains my work for the programming assignments in the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) on Coursera. The programming assignments involves building a deep neural network to recognize images of cats, culminating in a final project where you'll build a complete image recognition system.

The notebooks in this repository follow the same structure as the course, covering topics such as neural network architecture, backpropagation, optimization, and regularization. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises to help you build your understanding of deep learning and apply it to the practical example.

By sharing these notebooks on GitHub, I hope to contribute to the larger deep-learning community and make it easier for others to learn and experiment with these concepts. Whether you're just starting out in deep learning or looking to build on your existing knowledge, I believe these notebooks can be a valuable resource.

Feel free to clone this repository, run the notebooks locally, and experiment with your modifications and variations. I encourage you to share your own notebooks and insights with the community and contribute to the ongoing development of this exciting field.
